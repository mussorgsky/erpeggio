## Stuff that still has to be done

1. Doors that require keys to be opened
  - Item system so you can have keys
  - Doors that check for keys in the player's inventory
2. Item system
  - Typedef for items that has an enum which determines what kind of item it is
  - Further properties are taken from a list, depending on the enum
  - The player's inventory has a fixed size and is always full of items
  - Items can be marked as *empty*
  - Items can exist in the world by themselves
  - Items can be picked up by the player to their inventory
